# JavaScript Binary Search Tree

An implementation of a binary search tree data structure written in JavaScript.

Includes the following methods:
* `insert(value)` - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
* `remove(value)` - removes the node holding the given value from the tree
* `find(value)` - returns the node holding the given value in the tree
* `levelOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree in level order
* `inorder()` - traverses each node of the tree inorder
* `preorder()` - traverses each node of the tree preorder
* `postorder()` - traverses each node of the tree postorder
* `height()` - returns the height of a node -- defined as the longest path between the node and a leaf node
* `depth()` - returns the depth of a node -- defined as the distance between the node and the root
* `isBalanced()` - returns true/false based on whether or not the tree is balanced
* `rebalance()` - rebalances the tree
* `prettyPrint` - prints the tree in the console in a human reader friendly format
